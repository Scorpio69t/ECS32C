Comments in code are essential but not liked
Too many comments mean that your code is not clear enough
Completely ignored by compiler
#include stdio.h reads the contents of the header file stdio.h
Ctype.h, math.h, stdlib.h, string.h, time.h
Included files must be on include path
Idirectory with gcc
#include stdio.h searches for stdio.h first
Bad practice to unintialize variables, don't do int n; do int n = 0;
Functions must be declared before use, declaration called function prototype
Void - signifies no return value/arguments
Always return an integer, usual practice
But may see void main (void)
0 is false, anything else is true, but return value 0 also means success
